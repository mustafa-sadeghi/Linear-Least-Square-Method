    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This code provides an interactive visualization of different methods to compute the **Least Squares Regression Line** using vertical, horizontal, and perpendicular residuals. The goal of this visualization is to allow users to manually adjust the slope ($\\beta_1$) and intercept ($\\beta_0$) of a regression line and compare it with the automatically computed **Least Squares Line** for each residual type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code calculates the **Sum of Squared Distances (SSD)** for both the user-defined line and the automatically computed least squares line. The user can interactively visualize the effect of different slope and intercept values on the regression line's fit, using sliders for adjustments.\n",

    "1. **Linear Regression with Different Residuals**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In standard **Least Squares Regression**, the goal is to minimize the vertical distance between the data points and the regression line. This approach uses the formula:\n",

    "       \n",
    "       $$ \\text{Horizontal Residual} = x_i - \\hat{x}_i $$\n",

    "4. **Mathematical Insight**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The code offers a deep understanding of the least squares method by allowing users to explore different types of residuals and see their impact on the regression line and SSD. Users can learn why vertical residuals are typically used in the classic least squares method and how alternative methods (horizontal and perpendicular) affect the fit.\n",

    "\n",
    "In linear regression analysis, the **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** method is widely used to determine the best-fitting line by minimizing the **vertical residuals**, which are the differences between the observed $y$-values and the predicted $y$-values from the regression line. However, in certain scenarios, especially when there is measurement error in both $x$ and $y$ variables, it is more appropriate to minimize the **perpendicular residuals**—the shortest (orthogonal) distances from each data point to the regression line. This approach is known as **Total Least Squares (TLS)** or **Orthogonal Regression**.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Center the Data:**\n",
    "\n",

    "4. **Determine the Best-Fit Line:**\n",
    "\n",

    "##### Rationale:\n",
    "\n",
    "The right singular vector corresponding to the smallest singular value indicates the direction of least variance, which aligns with minimizing the perpendicular distances from the data points to the regression line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. Numerical Optimization Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, numerical optimization techniques can be employed to minimize $SSPR$ directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Steps to Perform Numerical Optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Objective Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The objective function to minimize is $SSPR$:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   SSPR(\\beta_1, \\beta_0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{\\beta_1 x_i - y_i + \\beta_0}{\\sqrt{\\beta_1^2 + 1}} \\right)^2\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Simplify:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   SSPR = \\frac{1}{\\beta_1^2 + 1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\beta_1 x_i - y_i + \\beta_0)^2\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Choose Initial Estimates:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Start with initial guesses for $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_0$. These can be the OLS estimates or any reasonable approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Select an Optimization Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Utilize algorithms such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Gradient Descent**\n",
    "   - **Newton-Raphson Method**\n",
    "   - **Quasi-Newton Methods (e.g., BFGS)**\n",
    "   - **Conjugate Gradient Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implement the Optimization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Use optimization techniques to iteratively adjust $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_0$ to minimize $SSPR$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iterate Until Convergence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Continue updating $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_0$ until the changes in $SSPR$ or the parameters themselves are below a predefined threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Obtain the Optimal Parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The values of $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_0$ at convergence are the estimates that minimize the sum of squared perpendicular residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Practical Implementation Example\n",
    "\n",
    "While numerical methods and SVD provide robust solutions for minimizing perpendicular residuals, the focus here is on understanding the mathematical derivation rather than implementation. However, it's essential to recognize that these methods require computational tools to handle the complexity of the equations involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimizing the sum of squared perpendicular residuals provides a more geometrically accurate fit, especially in scenarios where both $x$ and $y$ measurements contain errors. Unlike the OLS method, which offers a closed-form solution by minimizing vertical residuals, the Total Least Squares (TLS) method typically requires computational techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or numerical optimization algorithms to determine the optimal regression parameters $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Differences Between OLS and TLS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective:**\n",
    "  - **OLS:** Minimizes the sum of squared vertical residuals.\n",
    "  - **TLS:** Minimizes the sum of squared perpendicular residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assumptions:**\n",
    "  - **OLS:** Assumes errors are only in the $y$-direction.\n",
    "  - **TLS:** Accounts for errors in both $x$ and $y$-directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution:**\n",
    "  - **OLS:** Provides analytical solutions for $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_0$.\n",
    "  - **TLS:** Requires numerical methods or SVD for solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the distinction between these methods is crucial for selecting the appropriate regression technique based on the nature of the data and the underlying assumptions about measurement errors."
